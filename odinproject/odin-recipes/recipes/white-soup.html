    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>You might want to start by peeling and boiling the yam which would be pounded with a mortar and pestle. Pounded yam serves as a thickener but can also be eaten with other Nigerians soups.</li>
        <li>Grind the crayfish, uziza seeds; wash and slice the uziza leaves. You should also go ahead and wash the snail, in case you are including them. Snails are quite expensive in Nigeria so you can totally omit them.</li>
        <li>You can wash snails with alum to remove the slimy fluid.</li>
        <li>Parboil the assorted meat with all necessary ingredients. This soup is made with assorted beef; it’s usually a combination of different parts of cow meat-intestine, tripe, liver etc. You can also add few slices of goat meat.</li>
        <li>Parboil the meat for twenty to forty minutes until it is soft enough for consumption then you can go ahead to add the hot water-washed dry fish. This could be added earlier if you are using a strong dry fish like Mangala. Add about 3 cups of cold or boiled water.</li>
        <li>The amount of water for nsala soup depends on the ingredient thickener available and the number of people that you are making soup for.</li>
        <li>Boil for another ten to twenty minutes until they are both soft for consumption; then go ahead and add the ground crayfish, uziza seed and ground red pepper (please taste before adding red pepper, the uziza seeds are also very peppery).</li>
        <li>Taste your soup at this time and add stock cubes/salt to improve the taste if it doesn’t taste nice yet.</li>
        <li>You can go ahead and add the pounded yam you can add half and watch the for the next five minutes, if it is not thick enough you can add a little more.</li>
        <li>You can now go ahead and add the sliced uziza and utazi leaves. The utazi should be used sparingly for white soup; the reason is just to add a faint bitter taste.</li>
        <li>Allow to boil for the next few minutes and you can go ahead to serve your delicious ofe nsala with pounded yam, fufu or eba.</li>
    </ol>
